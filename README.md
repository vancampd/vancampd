### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Danny, a full-stack developer.

I am a self-starter, have a passion for detail, and am a recent bootcamp graduate  :mortar_board:. I love learning and applying knowledge through complex problems and am on a mission :rocket: to learn everything I can about computer science.

ðŸŒ± My list of things to study next includes: 
-  TypeScript 
-  Improving my understanding of Relational and Non-Relational Databases 
-  Data Structures and Algorithms

:books: I am currently reading Douglas Crockford's JavaScript: The Good Parts

:dog: I got a puppy during the pandemic and love going to parks or spending time with her.
