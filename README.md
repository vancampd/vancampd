### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Danny, a full-stack developer.

I am a self-starter, have a passion for detail, and am always working to improve. I made the career change into software development in July of 2021 and since have worked on a variety of applications, primarily using React JS and Node JS.

ðŸŒ± My list of things to study next includes: 
-  Remix vs Next JS (React SSR)
-  React Query

:books: I am currently reading Douglas Crockford's JavaScript: The Good Parts

:dog: I got a puppy during the pandemic and love going to parks or spending time with her.
